        <div class="bio">
            <p class="bio-text">I was born in 1991 and raised just outside New York City, leaving for college at the University of Texas at Austin, where I studied math and statistics and graduated in 2013. After moving back home where I spent a few busy years working in the service industry, my fiance and I decided to make a drastic lifestyle change and move to Portland. Here I decided to enroll in Portland State's Masters program for Computer Science in order to pursue a career in tech.</p>
